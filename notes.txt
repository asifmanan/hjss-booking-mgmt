I decided to use the mvc approach which i beleive is more
suitable for this project since its a data driven appliation
and the data is at the centre.

I decided to use a reusable multilevel menu which I created as a side project while doing this assignment.
So i kept it in a separate package (io.muxmenu) from the application.
